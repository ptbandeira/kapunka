# Prototype UX Notes

This interactive demo highlights premium user experience patterns:

- **Micro-interactions & animations**
  - Buttons transition with `0.2s` easing and scale on press.
  - Tooltips appear on hover or focus after a `0.3s` delay.
  - Skeleton components provide graceful loading feedback.
  - Page transitions fade and slide content between routes.
- **Navigation & flow**
  - Breadcrumbs keep the user oriented in the interface.
  - Search field suggests menu items and surfaces recent queries.
- **Accessibility & responsiveness**
  - Focus rings and ARIA helpers support keyboard and screenâ€‘reader users.
  - Layout uses flexible spacing for small and large viewports.
- **Feedback & confirmation**
  - Submitting the form triggers a success toast so users know the action completed.
